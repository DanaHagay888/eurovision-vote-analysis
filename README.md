# Data Visualization Portfolio

This repository showcases selected interactive dashboards and analytics projects.  
In addition, I have developed a **flagship project in Cybersecurity & Machine Learning** that demonstrates advanced skills in data engineering, anomaly detection, and reporting.  
This project is **available for presentation on demand** and will be shared during interviews.

## üöÄ Flagship Project (Available on Demand)

### Cybersecurity Capstone ‚Äì C++/Python + ML
- Built an **end-to-end desk system** for centralized log management and anomaly detection.  
- Developed pipeline to preprocess endpoint logs using **Pandas & NumPy** (cleaning, feature engineering, vectorization).  
- Applied **unsupervised clustering** (scikit-learn) with custom feature weighting to detect anomalies in heterogeneous data.  
- Delivered reports and visualizations for decision support, with storage and retrieval via **MongoDB**.  
- Enabled **adaptive anomaly detection** with continuous learning, improving accuracy over time.  
- Available for presentation on demand.
